Two ways to manage session:
1. HttpSession class
2. Cookies: text files stored in the browser's memory
             We can use cookies to enrich the user experience like we can store user's search query to shoe advts, or to store username and password, or form data 

             Cookies can also be used for managing the session
		
             
1. User will provide username and password
2. Request will be sent to LoginServlet
3. LoginServlet will compare username and password
4. If credentials matched:
	Create a cookie
	Store some data into it
        Send cookie in the response

JSP: Java Server Pages


In Servlets whenever it is required to have html we are calling print/println method
on printwriter reference we need to write tags inside a string only
Java Code -> html code

JSP overcomes the above drawback, in JSP file we can write java code and html code freely
HTML Code -> JAVA Code 

JSP is compiled into servlet at the execution time and Servlet will be executed only

How to write java code in JSP:
JSP is providing few tags:

1. declaration tag <%! %> : it is used to declare variables 
			<%! int a,b; %>
2. scriptlet tag 

3. expression tag

4. directives tag
