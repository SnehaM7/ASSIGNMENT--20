Session management:

Session: is used to maintain the state of a user throughout the application
If there are multiple servlets and JSPs and if we need certain data that can be used across them 

Login and Logout:

Login:
1. Username and Password are compared
2. If credentials got matched:
   Start a session
   Put the data for logged in user into the session
   If credentials didn't matched:
   Redirect a user back to login page

Logout:
1. Terminate the session then redirect a user to login page

Profile:
First We need to check if the session is there or not 
If session is found, then user is logged in and fetch the profile details
If session not found, user has arrived on this page without login so redirect a user back to login page
