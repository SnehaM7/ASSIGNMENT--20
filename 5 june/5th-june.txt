Naming convention for packages:

www.productcrud.com

reverse of the domain name will be the package name

com.productapp.utility

com.productapp.dao

com.productapp.daoimpl



PreparedStatement:

insert query has to be executed 100 times
100 different rows

Statement:

for(){ // 100 iterations
   stmt.executeUpdate(qry); 0.2 sec 
}

1st time -> statement will send qry to db -> db will compile -> execution 
2nd time -> 

Prepared Statement will not compile the query again and again,
it will compile query only once and later it will use this prepared query for execution

Web application:
Static Web: 
Dynamic Web: 

An app that interacts with the user or sends the different data for different users

HTML
CSS
JS

To develop dynamic web applications using JAVA, Servlet and JSP are there


Servlet : Is a java program running on a server, A Servlet is capable of listening to the requests, processing the request, and generating the response.

Apache Tomcat

Every server has a component Servlet Container, that is responsible for servlet execution

First of all every server will take index.html index.jsp file as the welcome file

However we can make our own html file as the welcome file using certain configuration
We can perform configurations related to the project (url mappings, welcome file, session timeout )
into an XML file
Java people has already defined the tags for each configuration
Place configuration XML file into web-inf

this Configuration XML file is termed as Standard deployment descriptor

web.xml

Before starting the execution, server will read web.xml file



Ways of creating web.xml:
1. Manually creating a new file
2. Eclipse can generate this file
   a. At the time of project creation
   b. After project has been created


Steps for creating a Servlet:

1. We have to create a class for servlet
2. Inherit HttpServlet 

javax.servlet -> Servlet version 4
jakarta.servlet -> Servlet version >= 5

class MyServlet extends HttpServlet{


}

download suitable jar file for servlet package based on the version
add that jar file into the dynamic web project
