Web applications using spring framework:

Servlet and JSPs

MVC : Separation of concerns


Controllers -> Servlets

/students
/students/1

class StudentController extends HttpServlet{
	service(){

	}
	doGet(){
		
	}
}

Spring MVC: provides an architecture to create MVC applications


client -> web.xml -> LoginServlet
                     AddServlet
                     AddProduct


client -> web.xml -> FrontController(DispatcherServlet) -> @Controller annotated classes 

In Spring mvc, we have already created servlet that will be executed first
this is a controller that will be executed first
DispatcherServlet 



In Spring mvc, we don't need to create multiple servlets instead of them we will be creating multiple controllers

@Controller
class StudentController{

}

created java folder in src/main dir
Added apache tomcat as the targeted runtime


After redirecting all the requests to DispatcherServlet in web.xml
We have to configure DispatcherServlet for searching our controllers
we have to create a config xml file for the same
name of file -> {servlet-name}-servlet.xml
for eg: servlet-name is frontcontroller the filename will be frontcontroller-servlet.xml
	dispatcher -> dispatcher-servlet.xml

Note: Any controller method should return a proper response 
	-> json response
        -> page in the response

ModelAndView class is used to send some data along with redirection on the view

InternalResourceViewResolver -> using this class, we can configure the extension of the view technology that we are using in the project

@Component-> special cases of the same annotation:
@Repository -> applied on a class in which db related operations are there
@Service -> applied on a class in which business logic is there
